### <span class="img-enh">Image Enhancer </span>
Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to increase the image definition and then deploy it as a web application

* &#9881;&#9881; [DEVELOPING...] &#9881;&#9881;

### <span class="obj-detc">Object Detection Application </span>

Creating an object detection model that can detect and track objects in a video stream, such as people, cars, or animals. Use the COCO dataset to train the model and then deploy it as a desktop application.

* &#9881;&#9881; [DEVELOPING...] &#9881;&#9881;

###  <span class="tw-sent">Twitter Sentiment about Specific Topic Web App </span>

Implementing natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze sentiment in some product, topic or event through tweets.Libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face's Transformers.

* &#9881;&#9881; [DEVELOPING...] &#9881;&#9881;

### <span class="llm-lang">LLM + LangChain `:bird:`:chains: projects</span>

Fine Tuning pre-trained LLM and link with other tools via LangChain :bird::chains:

Creating web scrapers using Beautiful Soup, Requests, or Scrapy to extract useful information:
* <span class="adif-st">adif-status:</span>
This Python module allows you to obtain the arrival times of trains at different stations in Spain using the Adif website. ([GitHub](https://github.com/fjguillen-96/adif-status)).

### <span class="sud-sol">Sudoku Solver</span> 

Developing a Sudoku solver using backtracking or other search algorithms, and then deploy the solver as a web application using Flask or Django. Allow users to upload images of Sudoku puzzles or enter the puzzle manually, and then display the solution on the screen.
